# Bank-Simulator
This application simulates the basic operations of a bank. Such operation such as creating a new account, login in, make transfers, desposit and withdraw money.

This project implements a linked list to store the differents bank accounts (account numbers, name, balance). It also implements two types of text files. Firtsly, a plain text file which stores the user credentials (account numbers and passwords) and secondly, an object file that will act as a data base (as for now i do not know how to implement a database) that will store the linked list for later executions.

This project is meant as a practice of linked list and file io.
